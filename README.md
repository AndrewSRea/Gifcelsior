# Gifcelsior

Using the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of the Avengers or any other superhero of your choice. 

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gifs of the Avengers from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.
When the user clicks one of the still Avengers GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Under every gif, a display of its rating (PG, G, so on) will appear.

Enjoy watching your favorite Avengers (or superheroes)!

Gifcelsior!
